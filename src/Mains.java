                 Ceasar's Cypher
                 This is a tool for en- and decrypting text with the famous "Ceasar's Cypher".
                 In order to use this tool properly you must take attention to the following:
                 -Only use the standard latin letters "a" to "z". If you use anything but, the program will crash. I'm not intending to work on a fix.
                 -Only use lowercase letters
                 -Do NOT use spaces
                 -Pray to God that the program will run properly
                 -Avoid using a key which is a multiple of 26
                \s
                 In order to decipher Text.
                 -Enter the key with a minus character up front,
                 -Enter encrypted key.
                 -Observe magic.""");

        The first task called to turn Umlaute into their written version ("Ã¤" to "ae" and so on...)
        However I'm not willing to do so because I'm a lazy fuck.
        I'll mitigate this issue by prompting the user to simply only enter the letters "a" to "z"
        The second task calls for a for-loop which turns each letter from the "plain" string into
        into a char "c". This char is then to be encrypted using the method "encrypt()"
        This char is then to be added to the String "encrpt"
        inside of that loop:
        encrpt += Character.toString( encrypt(c));
